# Tailwind CSS Not Detecting Classes in Vue Components from npm Package

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS with Vue components imported from an npm package.  Tailwind may fail to detect and apply the classes defined in those components. This is usually because the `content` option in your `tailwind.config.js` file doesn't include the correct paths to those components. 

## Problem

The `tailwind.config.js` file is missing the necessary path for Tailwind to properly scan the Vue components.  This results in classes not being applied correctly. 

## Solution

The solution lies in correctly configuring the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js`. The updated config includes the specific path to the Vue components within the npm package.
